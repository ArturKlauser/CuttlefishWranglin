The idea for this project came out of recent research the RNA editing

capabilities housed within the genome of cephalopods.





Found that RNA \(instead of DNA\) is highly edited in Octopus sp.





Occurs mostly in neurological tissue, but can also in occur in other

peripheral tissues.





Cuttlefish have not been studied.





In preparing for RNA transcriptome analysis, we realized that we did not have

a reference sequence to compare our transcriptome analysis to, so we decided

to sequence the genome as well.
